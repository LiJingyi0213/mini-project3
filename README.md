ios vs React native 
## The programming language
React Native: based on React.js, which is written in JavaScript. This is a major advantage when it comes to the fact that JavaScript is such an extensive and popular language that it’s very hard to find a programmer who hasn’t used it at some point in their career.
ios : First, it is easier to improve existing code. Second, it helps us avoid several types of mistakes. Third, it makes code much more readable

## platform 
react native:React Native provides a module that detects the platform in which the app is running. You can use the detection logic to implement platform-specific code. Use this option when only small parts of a component are platform-specific.
ios :Swift’s syntax and language constructions exclude the several types of mistakes possible in Objective-C. This stability means that there will be fewer crashes and cases of problematic behavior. 

### the advantage of ios 
  1.  Readability : Swift drops many legacy conventions, such as semicolons to end lines or parentheses that surround conditional expressions inside if/else statements.
  2.  Maintenance : It’s not possible for Objective-C to evolve without C evolving first. Contrarily, Swift does not have these dependencies, which makes it a lot easier to maintain.
  3.  Speed : Swift also provides various speed advantages during development, in turn, saving on costs. A complex object sort, for example, will run 3.9x faster than an implementation of the same algorithm in Python. That’s also better than Objective-C, which is 2.8x faster than the Python version.
  4.  Swift Supports Dynamic Libraries : This feature allows current Swift apps to link against newer versions of the Swift language as it evolves over time.
  5.   Open-Source : Open-sourcing Swift means that Apple will be able to get feedback from the community to make improvements on a consistent basis as independent developers contribute to the success of the language.
  
### the advantage of react native
1.  React Native helps in building cross platform mobile apps.
2.  Saves time and cost to build mobile apps on multiple platforms.
3.  Building blocks which are used in iOS and Android apps are also used while creating React Native based apps which means that React Native is a mobile framework that compiles app components for native mobile applications in JavaScript.

### conclusion 
make an iOS-only or Android-only app  -- native ios or android 
small team with limited time and resources, and need to make an app for both platforms  --  React Native.
highly complex app -- native ios or android
maintain the app over a long period of time -- native ios or android
have a strong React / Web development -- React Native
